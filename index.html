                    <p>It is our alumni whose significant contribution to the society has made our National Institute of Technology Durgapur (formerly, Regional Engineering College Durgapur) an institute of glory. Being a part of this glorious Institute, it becomes one of our prime duties to instil the essence of brotherhood into the minds of the alumni and their siblings from Alma-mater. We achieve this through the establishment of The NIT Durgapur Students Alumni Interaction (SAI) Cell. The SAI Cell is a group of students who voluntarily assist the functioning of the Centre for Alumni Affairs & International Relations (CAAIR). We are under the endorsement of the Dean (Alumni Affairs and Outreach). Having completely dedicated to nurturing the bond between students and alumni, the SAI Cell has become an indispensable part of the CAAIR and thus acting as a common platform for networking and interaction. We extend our hands towards our alumni and help them reconnect to their Alma- mater. Through regular interactions with the students, the alumni get a chance to share their valuable experiences and impart the knowledge they have acquired to the next generation of NITDIANs. Also, with this interchange, they get a glimpse of the young minds of the nation. We play an instrumental role in organising the Eminent Alumni Lecture, Student-Alumni Interaction in the campus, Industry-Institute-Interaction Program, Grand Alumni Homecoming, various other reunions and publication of the Annual Yearbook. However, we look forward to offering greater assistance to both our institute and alumni through innovative programs in a brighter future. With the aim of mending the broken link between students and alumni, the Alumni Cell launched the Alumni-Student Mentorship Program with the belief that close interaction with alumni will help students gather invaluable advice regarding overall development and will also aid them in taking crucial informative life-changing decisions. We feel their valuable experience would really enrich younger minds.</p>
